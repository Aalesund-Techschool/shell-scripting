If you want to challenge yourself more with bash programming exercises, try solving some of the exercises on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash/exercises). For example, [Acronyms](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash/exercises/acronym).

Checking out [solutions by others](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash/exercises/acronym/solutions) is also a great way to learn! However, try to solve the exercises yourself first for max effect!
